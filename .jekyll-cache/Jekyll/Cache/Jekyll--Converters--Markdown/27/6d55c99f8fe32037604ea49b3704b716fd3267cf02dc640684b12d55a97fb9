<p>Hack for LA requires two-factor authentication (2FA) in GitHub for all project contributors.</p>

<h1 id="to-enable-2fa">To Enable 2FA:</h1>
<h2 id="visit-and-follow-githubs-guide-to-setting-up-2fa">Visit and follow <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/configuring-two-factor-authentication" title="Github's Guide to Setting Up 2FA">Githubâ€™s Guide to Setting Up 2FA</a></h2>

<p>If you already have a 2FA application on your mobile phone, you can use that. If you do not already have a 2FA application you will be instructed to download your mobile app of choice (we have had good luck with Authy) and follow the detailed instructions to complete configuration in GitHub.</p>
