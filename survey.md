# Building a Survey Reporting Dashboard

Google Analytics includes a number of tools that allow individuals and teams to capture and analyze different types of data. These tools are especially valuable when it comes to survey-based user research.

This guide will walk through the integration of Google Forms, Google Sheets, and Google Data Studio in order to visualize a set of user survey data.

The example described includes connecting a Google Form to Google Sheets, cleaning a set of data within a Worksheet, and finally, building a data report in Google Data Studio.


## Link Google Form to Google Sheets

Link your survey results to a designated Google Sheets workbook


## Select Response Destination

Click the vertical elipsis located at the top right of the survey form.
