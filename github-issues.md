# Getting the Most Out of GitHub Issues

Each of Hack for LA’s GitHub project repositories (repos) use [issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to track and organize ideas, enhancements, and tasks. All team members will use GitHub issues to communicate in our multifunctional teams.

When creating a new GitHub issue, the following tips will help you provide consistent formatting, a clear and concise overview, actionable tasks, explanatory resources, and resumé items to add value for all volunteers.

*All GitHub Issues use markdown for formatting. View GitHub’s [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for a simple guide.*

## Issue Sections: Descriptions and Tips

Follow the recommendations below to create a useful end-to-end GitHub issue

*You can either format with markdown text manually or using the text box toolbar*

### TITLE

Describe what you’re working on —

For a start-to-finish issue, as in this case, choose a title that is generic enough to allow for all phases (research, ideation, design, development).

For an issue taking on only part of the workflow, be more declarative in what it covers (e.g. a research issue might be called “Determine Best Testing Library for Code Base”).
