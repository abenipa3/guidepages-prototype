# 2FA Guide

Hack for LA requires two-factor authentication (2FA) in GitHub for all project contributors.

# To Enable 2FA:
## Visit and follow [Github's Guide to Setting Up 2FA](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/configuring-two-factor-authentication "Github's Guide to Setting Up 2FA")

If you already have a 2FA application on your mobile phone, you can use that. If you do not already have a 2FA application you will be instructed to download your mobile app of choice (we have had good luck with Authy) and follow the detailed instructions to complete configuration in GitHub.
